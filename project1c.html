Glaciers are found on every continent except for Australia. They need a specific climate: generally a lot of snowfall during the winter and relatively cool temperatures during the summer.
 Glacier Hiking has become a tourist attraction in some countries, but it requires special knowledge of the constantly-changing environments and glacial features. Hazards like crevasses and 
 serac are difficult obstacles that glacier hikers should be aware of during this activity.
